1. Power up Vicon hub, run Tracker, and ensure drone Debbie is selected and
   tracked as an object.
2. Launch Matlab, open the drone_ilc model in Simulink, and (A) ensure it's 
   stopped, with all switches UP
3. Connect drone battery and connect WiFi to ardrone_xxxx network
4. In terminal, roslaunch brl_parrots pink_dongle_follow_virtual_ilc.launch
5. Check lights changed red/green when reset button pressed on panel
6. Run the Simulink model and verify that the "target" frame shows in RViz
7. On panel, click take off
8. With drone roughly near target, verify external inputs look small, and 
   select "External" checkbox.
9. In Simulink, move rightmost switch down to shift drone on to reference.
   Let it settle.
10. In Simulink, wait for the start of a reference cycle, and move leftmost
    switch down to start learning.
11. At end of learning trial, click "Stop" on panel, and land if work to be
    done. (Can keep flying if update is quick.)
12. Stop model and reset all switches UP.
13. In Matlab, run "arch_result" and log the test in text file.
14. If not changing battery, adjust Simulink settings and repeat from 6.
15. If changing battery, kill the roslaunch and repeat from 3.
